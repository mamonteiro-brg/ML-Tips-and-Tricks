It is common to use a specific cross-validation version called [k-fold cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.KFold). \n",
    "* When we are dealing with classification problems, I recommend you to use [stratified k-fold cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold). This will allow your *k* folds to keep the same proportion of class values. In regression problems you don't have this issue."
